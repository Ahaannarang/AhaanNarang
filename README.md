## Hi there 👋


# Hi, I'm Ahaan Narang 👋  

I'm a Mathematics & Computer Science student at Claremont Mckenna College (Incoming transfer to Columbia University), I am interested in **machine learning**, **full-stack engineering**, and **computational biology**. I enjoy building real world products, modeling complex systems, and applying ML across domains — from audio representation learning to building genomics pipelines.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

#### **💼 DineAbility**
A full-stack accessibility platform that maps wheelchair-friendly restaurants in singapore (www.dineability.sg)
- Public code in repo: *Dineability-Public*

### 🔹 **Genomics & Bioinformatics — Paid Undergraduate Researcher under Dr. Shibu Yooseph**
I work on computational genomics pipelines involving:
- Bowtie2 indexing and alignment workflows  
- Metagenomic mixture modeling  
- Microbial diversity analysis and environmental inference  
- Pipeline design for high-throughput genomic datasets  
- HPC workflows (Slurm, cluster computing)

This research builds my foundation in **algorithmic biology**, **probabilistic modeling**, and **large scale data systems**.

### 🔹 **Audio Representation Learning (Current Research)**
Part of an ML research group exploring:
- Convolutional models for **audio classification**
- Learned vs handcrafted representations  
- Style transfer and invariance in audio embeddings  
- Evaluation on datasets like AudioMNIST

My work includes architecture experimentation, preprocessing pipelines, and analysis of latent structure in learned audio features.

### 🔹 **Military ML & Full stack development Projects**
During Military Service, I worked in the digital intelligence domain with:
- Applied machine learning and application development for operational data processing  
- Building automation pipelines (report generation, object detection and tracking)
- Sentiment analysis systems for training evaluation  
- Selected as the best national servicemen for 2024

This experience taught me **deployment oriented ML**, **systems reliability**, and **data discipline under real constraints**.
