## Hi, I'm Ahaan Narang 👋  

I'm a Mathematics & Computer Science student at Claremont Mckenna College (Incoming transfer to Columbia University), I am interested in **applied machine intellgence **, **full stack engineering**, and **computational biology**. I enjoy building real world products, modeling complex systems, and applying ML across domains — from audio representation learning to building genomics pipelines.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On


### 🔹 **Genomics & Bioinformatics — Paid Undergraduate Researcher under Dr. Shibu Yooseph**
I work on computational genomics pipelines involving:
- Bowtie2 indexing and alignment workflows  
- Metagenomic mixture modeling  
- Microbial diversity analysis and environmental inference  
- Pipeline design for high-throughput genomic datasets  
- HPC workflows (Slurm, cluster computing)
